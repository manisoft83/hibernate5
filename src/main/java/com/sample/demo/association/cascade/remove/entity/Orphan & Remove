@OneToMany(orphanRemoval = true, mappedBy = "stockPersist")

orphanRemoval = true is required to remove only child record.
orphanRemoval = true mentioned in Parent POJO entity.
Here,in sample removing StockDailyRecordRemove record only by using  orphanRemoval = true.

Without that Hibernate is not removing child record.
Whole set of parent and child records are deleted if we use session.delete(stock);.

Don't use CascadeType.ALL, CascadeType.REMOVE in  StockDailyRecordRemove POJO which will remove parent and all childs if we try to remove one child. CAREFULL with REMOVE.
